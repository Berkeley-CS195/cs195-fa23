~ title: Course Description and Policies

CS 195 is a discussion-intensive course about the social implications of
computer technology. The purpose of this course is to help students make
informed and thoughtful choices about their careers, participation in society,
and future development activities. Readings and lecture topics are drawn from a
range of fields that together seek to describe our contemporary global society:
sociology, philosophy, economics, public policy, etc. 

Weekly Schedule
---------------

Lecture: Wednesday 12:00 to 1:30 PM

Readings for each week will be released on the Wednesday before class (or thereabouts).

**Please finish the readings before class!**

Lecture topics will not be determined only by the wisdom of your instructor.
Instead, you will collectively choose your own adventure through the material.  To guide discussion topics, a weekly survey will be announced on Piazza.

**Finish the weekly survey by 11:59 pm Tuesday!**

Essays
------

You will write three short essays (500-1000 words) of varying format 
in relation to issues discussed in class.  Essays will be 
announced on the website, in class, and
on Piazza.

Essays are peer reviewed, which means you will review nine essays and have each
of your essays reviewed by three of your peers.  You will also have the option
of posting your essays publicly.

Grading
-------

The course is graded P/NP. The reason for that policy is to ensure that you can
feel free to express opinions different from those of the instructors, both in
class meetings and in written work.

In order to receive a passing grade in CS 195, you must complete the objectives
listed below:

 * Attend at least 11 (out of 13) lectures
 * Complete at least 10 (out of 12) pre-lecture surveys.
 * Submit 3 essays and receive a passing peer review grade on all of them.
 * Provide peer reviews for 9 essays.

In the event that you do not earn the required number of points, we will provide
an opportunity to make up extra work, though you should not count on this. 

Lecture and Attendance
---------------

Lecture is going to be a mix of discussion, video clips, students asking questions,
small group discussion, and class-wide debriefing. Attendance will be taken in
class.
