## Assignment Description

The goal is for you to explore a topic that you find interesting! Choose your
own essay related to one of the lecture topics from the first five weeks. You
may also discuss multiple topics. Here are the three frames you may choose:

Multi-sided debate
: Discuss a controversial and/or
  unresolved issue related to your chosen topic. This could be a current or
  historical debate, where you choose a side (please explain why you chose this
  side) and discuss the merits and demerits of both sides of the argument so
  that readers have a clear view of all sides.

Impact of Computing on Society
: Choose a field of study, hobby, or profession, social structure (e.g.,
  personal, professional, government, community) and describe how computing is
  affecting it with an emphasis on your choice of lecture topic. You could
  choose, for example, the responsibility of rank-and-file engineers to protect
  user privacy from government surveillance.

Emerging Technology
: Discuss an emerging technology. What are its social implications on your
  chosen topic? How does this new technology affect your chosen lecture topic?

The goal is for you to branch from the lecture ideas to explore a topic that you find interesting.
If you’re not sure if something would be a good fit, please do ask us!

For example (you may not use this):

Suppose I were very interested in Government Censorship and Surveillance,
specifically the conversation around how Facebook is trying to adjust its
business model to avoid losing business in censorship heavy countries. I
start from this
[article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/technology/facebook-government-regulations.html?_r=0)
and center my essay around the question, "How do Social Media companies gain
market share in censored markets?"

### Evidence and Credibility

You should have at least <b>three</b> sources throughout the essay. At least
two of the sources must be from resources not shared in class; other sources
may be a reading or link presented in class.

Sources should be of different types and try to capture multiple perspectives.
For example, three TikTok videos, or three NYT Opinion pieces about the same
topic typically do not offer a range of perspectives.

- Tiktok videos, YouTube, podcasts, Twitch streams, Quora, Wikipedia, etc. can
  provide cultural/social context, or can serve as an “individual’s
  perspective.”
  - Individuals’ perspectives are evidence of experience, but cannot always
    be treated as factually accurate.
- For technical information, socioeconomic information, historical facts, cite
  sources from journalists, researchers, and/or academics.
  - Often well-sourced “history compilation” videos will have references, so
    please include those in addition to the video itself.
- The “Op-Ed” or opinion sections (“opinion pieces”) of trusted sources should
  not be treated as having the same level of factual accuracy as the news and
  investigative work.
- Remember: Wikipedia, Quora, Stack Overflow, etc. are fine places to start,
  but you should not cite an entire article or page from a crowd-sourced
  website. A well-written Wikipedia article includes its own references at the
  end of page. Those are often great options to use.

### Original or Unique Thoughts

We expect you to construct an original essay that goes beyond summarizing and
explaining any cited sources. To extend the Social Media/Censorship/Market
example above, I could compare and contrast two company models, each explained
by a different source. I could also argue a theme that connects together
seemingly disjoint experiences around censorship as reported in different
sources.

We also encourage you to bring in your personal experiences into your argument!
To extend the Social Media/Censorship/Market example, I could share a personal
anecdote about my own experience with surveillance on social media, or
introduce a set of cultural values that influence how I view social media, and
then contrast/connect this perspective with those demonstrated in other cited
evidence.

## Essay Format

Title
: Please include your selected lecture topic (or topics) at the top of the
  page.

Essay Length
: Essays should be short: 700-1000 words, excluding references.

References
: Include your references separately at the end of the essay. The format is not
  important as long as the references are unambiguous and include website links
  as full URLs where applicable. For example:

  NPR, "New Research Casts Doubt On Connection Between Smartphone Use And Teen
  Mental Health.” <https://www.npr.org/2019/08/19/752529380/new-research-casts-doubt-on-connection-between-smartphone-use-and-teen-mental-he>
  Accessed 9/19/22.

Style
: The essay does not require a particular format (APA, MLA, etc are acceptable).
  However, it is a college-level essay, and the writing should still be
  professional.

Format
: The bCourses assignment will accept a PDF. This PDF must contain English
  prose.

(Optional) Peer Anonymity
: Your essay will be peer-graded through bCourses, so other students will see
  your submitted document (and any identifying information on the document
  itself). While we encourage you to share personal stories as part of your
  essay, if you do not feel comfortable sharing parts of your identity (e.g.,
  name) with peer reviewers, then do not include it in the document itself.
  Instructors will still be able to associate submissions with students
  enrolled in the course.

## Submission

The essay will be submitted in [bCourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1521861/assignments/8568483).
Please visit our syllabus for our [Accommodations policy](../about.html#accommodations).

## Grading and Rubric

Your essay will be evaluated by three of your peers on each of the following
criteria (each on a 2-point scale):

{: .rubric-table }
| Category | 2 points | 1 point | 0 points |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Essay is a coherent discussion of a topic presented in class. | Discusses the listed topic (or topics) in a coherent, balanced argument. | Attempts an argument, but it should be rewritten. | Incoherent/Irrelevant/blank |
| Essay presents original or unique thoughts. | Extends the reasoning and analysis beyond a summary of cited sources. | Makes an attempt to extend or link together reasoning beyond a summary of cited sources. | Does not go beyond a summary of cited sources. |
| Uses 3 sources of evidence | Cites at least 3 sources. Sources should not all be individual perspectives/opinion pieces. | Cites < 3 sources, or less than 2 from outside class. Or, all 3 sources are opinion pieces, i.e., sources not always backed by evidence. | Cites 1 or 0 sources. |
| Essay writing is clear. | Uses well-written sentences with few spelling/grammatical errors. | Has several stylistic/spelling/grammatical errors that detract from the essay. | Illegible/blank |

Instructional staff may also spot-review essays and provide comments/share ideas.
