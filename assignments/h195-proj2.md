Lesson Plan, Slides, Presentation
: **Due Friday 3/24, 3:59 PM PT** (this due date is before discussion)

## Overview

In this project, you get to design an H195 discussion! You will build a lesson
plan for a 50-minute discussion for future H195 students to engage critically
with the *social context* of a particular *computing technology* or *concept*.
We will provide readings on pedagogical practices.

You may do this assignment in pairs.

## Topic Selection

The topic can be, broadly, anything that you are interested in as long as it
has a computing component and a society component.

For example, I could choose to design a discussion around FOSS (free and
open-source software), covering its history and sustainability in capitalism.
If you're uncertain whether a topic would be a good fit, please ask!

Some of the things that you shared at the beginning of the term in response to
the question "What do you want to get out of this course?" might be good
starting points.

On bCourses, submit a few sentences explaining your chosen computing topic and
how you plan to draw a connection to society or identity concepts.
Additionally, please provide a link or citation for one possible pre-reading.

This is due Friday 3/10, 11:59 PM PT.

### Pedagogy Readings

Please read the following:

- [Tools for Teaching][], (p. 97-p.101, PDF 115-119). Read up to and including
  "Starting a Discussion."
- [How to Write Learning Outcomes][]

[Tools for Teaching]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pisWNHtrfKiBd_8a-vsBuqv0sdK6QB2S/view
[How to Write Learning Outcomes]: https://teaching.berkeley.edu/resources/design/course-level-learning-goalsoutcomes

## Readings Selection

Select 3-4 readings that students should read prior to discussion that will
situate your chosen technology or concept in the context of society. Readings
should take about 1 to 1.5 hours maximum.

Outstanding thoughts (Ethan):

- Requiring specific source breakdown?
  - Books (Berkeley library or online)
  - Articles? Op-eds? Other allowed / suggested sources?
- Feels narrow. Design an activity from the sources, besides the reading notes?

This is due Friday 3/17, 11:59 PM PT.

## Lesson Plan, Slides, Presentation

- Lesson plan (total 50 minutes)
  - Two discussion questions; possibly one
  - Background for question
  - Why did you choose this question / framing? What do you want students to
    take away?
- To answer this, slide deck. Target 10 minute presentation.
  - Data 6 table
  - Introduction: What are the computing topic and social context you are
    exploring?
  - Required readings: Why did you choose each reading? What do you hope
    students take away from each?
  - Discussion plan
    - Lesson plan, working from Data 6 table

This is due Friday 3/24, 3:59 PM PT, to be presented in discussion!
