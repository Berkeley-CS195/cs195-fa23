Lesson Plan, Slides, Presentation
: **Due Friday 3/24, 3:59 PM PT** (this due date is before discussion)

## Overview

In this project, you get to design an H195 discussion! You will build a lesson
plan for a 50-minute discussion for future H195 students to engage critically
with the *social context* of a particular *computing technology* or *concept*.
We will provide readings on pedagogical practices.

You may do this assignment in pairs.

## Topic Selection

The topic can be, broadly, anything that you are interested in as long as it
has a computing component and a society component.

For example, I could choose to design a discussion around FOSS (free and
open-source software), covering its history and sustainability in capitalism.
If you're uncertain whether a topic would be a good fit, please ask!

Some of the things that you shared at the beginning of the term in response to
the question "What do you want to get out of this course?" might be good
starting points.

On bCourses, submit a few sentences explaining your chosen computing topic and
how you plan to draw a connection to society or identity concepts.
Additionally, please provide a link or citation for one possible pre-reading.
You aren't obligated to use this pre-reading -- this is just to give me a sense
of the direction you're planning on going.

This is due Friday 3/10, 11:59 PM PT.

### Pedagogy Readings

Please read the following:

- [Tools for Teaching][], (p. 97-p.101, PDF 115-119). Read up to and including
  "Starting a Discussion."
- [How to Write Learning Outcomes][]

[How to Write Learning Outcomes]: https://teaching.berkeley.edu/resources/design/course-level-learning-goalsoutcomes

## Readings Selection

Select 3-4 readings that students should read prior to discussion that will
situate your chosen technology or concept in the context of society. Student
readings should take about 1 to 1.5 hours in total, maximum.

We won't require specific kinds of sources, but please limit yourself to at
most two opinion pieces (and at most one from any single group). Additionally,
the UC Berkeley library is a good source for accessing possible readings.

Secondly, design a short "pre-work" activity for students to complete,
which should involve about a paragraph of writing.

This is due Friday 3/17, 11:59 PM PT.

## Presentation

### Slides

Your presentation should be between 7-10 minutes, and cover the following:

Introduction / Contexualization
: What are the computing topic and social context you are exploring?

Readings
: Why did you choose each reading?

Lesson Plan
: See below for instructions.

Additionally, include a slide with 2-3 "instructor readings," or sources
that you think an instructor would find useful, but may be too in-depth for a
student. This slide will not be presented.

### Lesson Plan

Construct at least two activities where students engage with the social context
of the computing technology. You may use one activity, but you should justify
why it is the only activity for a 50-minute discussion. For example, I
typically use two discussion questions, with paired discussion followed by
whole-group discussion, aiming to spend around 25 minutes total on each.

You should present a slide, or multiple that addresses the following list:

Introduction
: How will you introduce the discussion section? For example, will you provide
  any additional context beyond the readings?

Recall Activity (Optional)
: Pose a question you to get students positioned and warmed up to discuss. It
  often involves students "recalling" what was in their required readings.

Question 1-N
: - How will you structure the discussion of this question (in small groups,
    pairs, as a class, a mixture, or something else)? Will you have time to
    review as a class before or after the activity?
  - Write a sentence for the instructor-facing lesson plan, e.g. "By the end of
    this activity, students will be able to..." (See [Action Verbs])
  - Share the main student-facing takeaway(s) that you will state for students
    at the activity, if any.

This is due Friday 3/24, 3:59 PM PT, to be presented in discussion!
