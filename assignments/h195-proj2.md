## Overview

This project is (thematically) a continuation of Project 2. You are free to do
"whatever you want," as it relates to the themes of our class. While Project 2
focused on a discussion section for students, Project 3's deliverable could
accomplish some of the following goals for a *<u>community</u>*:

- Raise awareness
- Design an intervention
- Engage the community in an issue

This project may be (and is encouraged to be) completed in groups. If you decide, you may even do the project as an entire class if it is large enough. 

## Guidelines on Project Scope

Plan on doing something that takes about 4.5-7.5 hours per week. That number should be understood very
generously--i.e., it's understood to include time spent pondering what you want
to do for your project, not just time actively typing.

## 1. Topic and Project Selection

In Week 10 ({{page.topicdue}}), we will do a "post-it" brainstorming activity in pairs or groups on
possible topics and projects; and possibly form groups.

Some past projects from previous CS 195 Students:

- (TO BE ADDED)

Some past projects from students that have done a similar project at Stanford:

- Write a paper gathering and analyzing information about something (e.g., look
  at the "Diversity" page on the website of major tech companies and analyze
  what it seems the companies want to communicate or what they want the
  audience to believe about them; how believable is this in practice?)
- Create a website with profiles of Stanford CS/engineering students with a
  variety of backgrounds, sharing their stories and what excites them about tech
- Make tiktok videos educating teens about issues with search engine and
  autocomplete results
- Record a podcast episode talking about your own experience in
  CS/tech/Berkeley EECS classes, and connecting it to what research says about
  broader trends in how tech cultures affect individuals
- Design a PSA about a particular technology, such as the effects it has on your
  chosen community
- *Note*: We'd like you to do something that is somewhat different from Project 1.

## 2. Proposal

The project proposal outlines what your project will be and is due via bCourses by {{page.proposaldue}}, 11:59pm. The proposal spec is as follows:

Submit a google doc link with comment access for the TAs including a brief synopsis of what you plan to do for your project, and who are your partners if you have them.

This synopsis can range from 2-5 sentences in length, and can be (slightly) modified in the future. However, we want you to stay mostly committed to the project you describe in this submission.

We want to know about your topic, issue, intended/possible audience, and implementation. Specifics need not be included unless you know them at this point.

## 3. Presentation

Target between 7-10 minutes, and cover the following:

- Project goals. Who were you trying to reach? On what topic? Why?
- What you did
- How do you feel about how it went? What is the impact? What are you most
  proud of about regarding how your project unfolded? How did your project
  influence others or influence your own views?

We will send out a survey about which presentation date would work best: either {{page.presentationdue}} as an extended section, or early RRR.
