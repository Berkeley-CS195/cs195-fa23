## Assignment Description

Pick a topic, a related piece of media, and a CS195 classmate and talk about it for 7-10 minutes! Review others! Read below for more detail.

## Podcast Details

One of the learning goals of this course is to share and engage your opinions about the social implications of computing technology, particularly with others. Since most of you will engage with these implications through spoken conversation, we’re hoping that this will be a better simulation of what you will do in practice—as opposed to a written essay.

You will record a 7-10 minute audio file of you talking with **one or two other people** in the course. This does not have to be an Audible/Spotify-level production, but the audio quality should be clear enough such that an automatic captioner would reasonably be able to pick up on most words. We share some resources for recording audio at the end of this assignment. 

The goal of this assignment is a conversation between classmates. You do not need to submit a written script (beyond any automatic transcription; see below). However, both you and your partner should speak roughly an equal amount of time, and there shouldn’t be too many extra-long pauses (e.g., 5-10 seconds of pausing every once in a while is fine, but a longer amount of silence is not). Heuristically, aim for the amount of speaking you see in a podcast or internet stream. With these two things in mind (no script required, but conversation should keep both parties engaged), if you need it, we encourage you to outline some thoughts ahead of time. You may need to do several recordings!

## Topic choice and required media

You must pick a topic related to what we will have covered in lecture, from Lecture 07: The AI Debate up to and including Lecture 13: Memes, Misinformation, and Information Literacy.

As part of your discussion, cite or discuss one news article, tweet, video from Tiktok/YouTube/etc., academic paper, or other relevant form of media that is outside of the ones discussed or shared in class. You can include multiple of these if that’s what you want to talk about, but just one is required for submission.

Both the topic and the title/author should be stated at the beginning of the podcast. Or, if the media is not titled (e.g., a tweet), you should say as much of it as needed for a listener to look up the tweet (e.g., read the short tweet aloud).

## Project partner search

You should “register” your group of 2-3 students total (that is, you and 1-2 other students) via bCourses.
* *Groups are two to three students.* No groups of one will be permitted for this assignment.
* We will have a pinned Ed post to search for project partners. If you post on this thread, we ask that you mark your threads as “resolved” to help other students search.
* Register your partners via bCourses by {{ page.date.proposal | date: "%a %m/%d" }}, {{site.assignment_time}}. Unassigned students by this time will be automatically assigned within 24 hours and notified via email.
* [How do I join a group as a student?](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-join-a-group-as-a-student/ta-p/468)
* Everyone in your group should self sign-up to the same **Podcast 2** Group via bCourses. If you are having trouble finding an open group, please search for "Podcast 2" as per the below screenshot:

## Submission
Submit your podcast via bCourses (see the assignment link at the top of this page).
* Only one person from each group will need to submit to bCourses.
* **You must announce your topic and the media you are citing at the beginning of your podcast.** This will greatly facilitate peer and staff grading.
  * Unlike Podcast 1, you do not need to submit any separate form stating your topic/media piece. Just state it at the beginning of your podcast.
* **File renaming**: Remember that peer reviewers will view your filename when they download; please rename your file if you would like to prefer anonymity. We suggest using a short-form version of your email hash, since you have already computed it.
* **Transcript submissions**: If you prefer to submit a text transcript of your conversation for peer grading; details on how to use Zoom recordings for auto-transcript are at the bottom of the assignment page. Please note that you will need to ALSO submit the audio file to the [Optional] bCourses assignment, viewable to instructors only. That bCourses link is also at the top of this page.
* If you need an extension, please fill out [the Extension/Regrade Request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDIBx-Q4-jtYq0FERjOmlDAfmdAn9k47kQlF7-iRQebcwzJw/viewform).

## Grading and Rubric

Since this is a pair assignment, if all goes well your assignment will receive four anonymous peer reviews. Each person therefore will have to submit two peer reviews (see “Peer Review” below).

A passing grade on a podcast is such that all rubric categories are marked “Satisfactory” by all peer reviewers. 

{: .rubric-table }
| Category | 1 point | 0 points |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Uploaded file is a text file (.vtt, .txt, PDF, word doc, etc.) or an audio file that contains the group conversation. | Satisfactory | File is a video file / File is not the conversation file. |
| Conversation topic is pertinent to one (or more) of the specified lectures. | Satisfactory | Conversation is not pertinent to class. |
| The conversation cites or discusses the uploaded piece of media (news article, tweet, video from Tiktok/YouTube/etc., academic paper) in a relevant manner. | Satisfactory | Conversation neither cites nor discusses a new piece of media outside of class resources. |
| Conversation does not have particularly long pauses (e.g., longer than 15 seconds) and is within the time limit. | Satisfactory | Conversation includes an extra-long pause / contains so many pauses such that it cannot be considered satisfying the 7-10 minute requirement / Time limit is 7-10 minutes or thereabouts. |
| Conversation feels relatively balanced, i.e., it flows back and forth. | Satisfactory | One person is dominating the speaking time / One person takes the first half, then the other person takes the second half (or split three-wise). |

Instructional staff will spot-review some podcasts and will explicitly re-review any submissions that do not achieve “Satisfactory” in all rubric items.

## Peer Review

As part of the grading process for this course, each person will anonymously submit two peer reviews, which includes (1) submitting the above rubric **and** (2) posting a single “Reply” as a text comment on the assignment on bCourses.

Peer Reviews will be randomly assigned via bCourses.

(1) How to submit the above rubric:
* See this [Canvas post](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-submit-a-peer-review-to-an-assignment/ta-p/293) for guidance.

(2) How to submit a “Reply”:
* Post a question, quote and discuss, or comment on your classmates’ podcast. See the QQCR guidelines.
* Submit this as a text comment in the peer review assignment you are assigned to.
* Just like for QQCRs, you should be civil in your responses. Your classmates have worked hard on this assignment, and they will read your comments! One rule of thumb for constructive commenting: Instead of “I don’t like/I disagree,” say “I like” and “I wish…”
* See the [syllabus](../syllabus.html#community-guidelines) for further guidelines, as well as how to report comments that violate the Code of Student Conduct.

## Audio Resources

The easiest way to make an audio file AND an automatically generated transcript is to record your conversation via Zoom.
* Start a Zoom; you and your partner do not need to both sign on, but if you are in the same room then both of you should be in front of the microphone.
* Click the “Record to the Cloud” or “Record to my Computer” and start your conversation.
* After you finish, click “End Meeting” or “Stop Recording.”
* After you end the meeting, if you selected “Record to my Computer” then your files will be available locally. If you selected “Record to the Cloud” you will need to wait for Zoom to email you a link to download your files.
* Upon viewing the files, you will see an .mp4 video file, .m4a audio file, a .vtt text transcript file. You can upload either the .m4a audio file or the .vtt text file to the bCourses file submission (do not upload the .mp4 video file!!)
* If you choose to upload the .vtt text transcript file, you must also separately email your group’s audio file to the course staff. See the “Submission” details above for the correct email subject heading.
