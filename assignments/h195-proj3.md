## Overview

This project is (thematically) a continuation of Project 2. You are free to do
"whatever you want," as it relates to the themes of our class. While Project 2
focused on a discussion section for students, Project 3's deliverable could
accomplish some of the following goals for a *<u>community</u>*:

- Raise awareness
- Design an intervention
- Engage the community in an issue

This project may be (and is encouragedt to be) completed in groups.

## Guidelines on Project Scope

Since we are a 3-unit class and are supposed to have about
[6 hours of work outside of class per week](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2023-spring-compsci-h195-001-lec-001),
and this project should occupy your last 1-2 weeks of the class, plan on doing
something that takes about 9-15 hours. That number should be understood very
generously--i.e., it's understood to include time spent pondering what you want
to do for your project, not just time actively typing.

## 1. Topic and Project Selection

In Week 12 ({{page.topicdue}}), we will do a "post-it" brainstorming activity in pairs or groups on
possible topics and projects; and possibly form groups.

Some past projects from students that have done a similar project at Stanford:

- Write a paper gathering and analyzing information about something (e.g., look
  at the "Diversity" page on the website of major tech companies and analyze
  what it seems the companies want to communicate or what they want the
  audience to believe about them; how believable is this in practice?)
- Create a website with profiles of Stanford CS/engineering students with a
  variety of backgrounds, sharing their stories and what excites them about tech
- Make tiktok videos educating teens about issues with search engine and
  autocomplete results
- Record a podcast episode talking about your own experience in
  CS/tech/Berkeley EECS classes, and connecting it to what research says about
  broader trends in how tech cultures affect individuals
- Design a PSA about a particular technology, such as the effects it has on your
  chosen community
- *Note*: We'd like you to do something that is not a lesson plan, given that Project 2 already engaged with the classroom environment.

By the end of the day ({{page.topicdue}}, 11:59pm), you will need to submit a quick summary of what you did here on bCourses. One submission per group.

## 2. Proposal

The project proposal outlines what your project will be and is due via bCourses by {{page.proposaldue}}, 11:59pm. The sections of the
proposal are as follows:

1. 1-2 paragraphs (about 500 words) describing the project vision.
2. Separate list of additional resources or readings, like those on our
   syllabus, that relate to your project or inform its design. You aren't
   strictly required to have any, but many projects will have some and it will
   be good to track them.
3. (If you worked in a group) A list of the members of your team, and a bullet
   list breakdown describing
   what each member is responsible for. (If a team of one, still give a bullet
   list breakdown of the individual tasks required to complete this project.)
   Assign a very rough hours estimate to complete each task. This is an
   opportunity to practice the skill of professionalism in project management.
   In part that means: please do not be heroic in assigning these estimates.
   Would it take 10 minutes if everything goes right and you know exactly what
   to do and how to do it at the outset? That's probably a minimum 1 hour task
   then, being realistic. Good project managers build in time for fishing about
   for what to do, re-doing work that was done when there is an unexpected
   hiccup, etc. That said, professionalism also means not grotesquely "padding"
   the estimates.
4. 1-2 paragraphs (about 500 words) describing the main open questions or
   potential areas of concern on the horizon for this project. This is in part
   to help you foresee problems for yourselves by stopping to consider this. It
   is also in part to communicate with us so we can help you address open
   questions, find additional resources, organize around concerns, etc.

## 3. Presentation

Target between 7-10 minutes, and cover the following:

- Project goals. Who were you trying to reach? On what topic? Why?
- What you did
- How do you feel about how it went? What is the impact? What are you most
  proud of about regarding how your project unfolded? How did your project
  influence others or influence your own views?

We will send out a survey about which presentation date would work best: either {{page.presentationdue}} as an extended section, or early RRR.
