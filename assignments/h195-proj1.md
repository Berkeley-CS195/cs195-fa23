For Q4, CS 182 is a Stanford class that covers similar content to CS H195, with
a focus on the public policy angle. You can instead assume that the executive
team has done the corresponding work for CS (H)195.

Submit a PDF on bCourses to the submission link above.

If you modify the simulation code, please make a note of it in your writeup.
