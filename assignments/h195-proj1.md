## Overview

In this project, you get to design an H195 discussion! You will build a lesson
plan for a 50-minute discussion for future H195 students to engage critically
with the *social context* of a particular *computing technology* or *concept*.
We will provide readings on pedagogical practices.

You may do this assignment in pairs.

## Topic Selection

The topic can be, broadly, anything that you are interested in as long as it
has a computing component and a society component.

Some of the things that you shared at the beginning of the term in response to
the question "What do you want to get out of this course?" might be good
starting points.

On bCourses, submit a few sentences explaining your chosen computing topic and
how you plan to draw a connection to society or identity concepts.
Additionally, please provide a link or citation for one possible pre-reading.
You aren't obligated to use this pre-reading -- this is just to give me a sense
of the direction you're planning on going.

For example, if I were to do this assignment, I might design a discussion
around FOSS (free and open-source software), covering its history and
sustainability in capitalism, and select the
[`core-js` README by zloirock][core-js] as a possible pre-reading. If you're
uncertain whether a topic would be a good fit, please ask!

[core-js]: https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/71ea97c987e793d3c44f4a7cee78dffe17771c05/README.md

### Pedagogy Readings

Please read the following:

- [Tools for Teaching][], (p. 97-p.101, PDF 115-119). Read up to and including
  "Starting a Discussion."
- [How to Write Learning Outcomes][]
- [Establish Course-level Learning Objectives][]
- [5E Lesson Plan][]
- [Knowledge Integration Environment][]

## Readings Selection + Activity Pilot

1. Select 3-4 readings that students should read prior to discussion that will
   situate your chosen technology or concept in the context of society. Student
   readings should take about 1 to 1.5 hours in total, maximum.

   We won't require specific kinds of sources, but please limit yourself to at
   most two opinion pieces (and at most one from any single group). Additionally,
   the UC Berkeley library is a good source for accessing possible readings.

2. Design a short "pre-work" activity for students to complete, which should
   involve about a paragraph of writing.

3. Brainstorm one 25-minute discussion activity to engage the students
   critically with the social context and implications of your chosen topic.
   The 25 minutes or so should include all parts (intro, exercise, takeaway/
   synthesis).

4. **Pilot**: Try it out with 3-4 friends! For maximum effect, ask them to skim / do the
   readings.

5. Then, complete a 1-page writeup that consists of:

   - Your chosen readings
   - Your chosen pre-work activity
   - Your activity plan (see [below](#activity-plan))
   - Your learning goal(s) for the activity
   - A reflection on the pilot: What went well, what can be improved.
   - Any changes that you plan to make for the final deliverable.

Submit as a Google Doc link to bCourses, and make sure to enable Commenting for the TA(s) to give feedback before your presentation.

### Activity Plan

Construct one 25-minute activity where students engage with the social context
of the computing technology. In your writeup, address the following:

Introduction
: How will you introduce the discussion section? For example, will you provide
  any additional context beyond the readings?

Recall Activity (Optional)
: Pose a question you to get students positioned and warmed up to discuss. It
  often involves students "recalling" what was in their required readings.

Activity Structure
: How will you structure the discussion of this question (in small groups,
  pairs, as a class, a mixture, or something else)? Will you have time to
  review as a class before or after the activity?

Learning Goal/Outcome
: Write 1-2 sentence for the instructor-facing lesson plan, e.g. "By the end of
  this activity, students will be able to..." (See [Action Verbs])

Main Takeaway
: Share the main student-facing takeaway(s) that you will state for students
  at the activity.

## Presentation

### Slides

Your presentation should be between 7-10 minutes, and cover the following:

Introduction / Contexualization
: What are the computing topic and social context you are exploring?

Readings
: What are your readings, and why did you choose each reading?

Activity Plan
: See above. You should present a slide, or multiple that addresses your
  activity plan. Briefly discuss why this activity meets learning goals and provoke discussion.

Pilot
: How did the pilot go, and what did you change or improve as part of your discussion?

Additionally, include a slide with 2-3 "instructor readings," or sources
that you think an instructor would find useful, but may be too in-depth for a
student. This slide will not be presented.

Submit as a Google Slides link to bCourses, and make sure to enable public view. We plan to post all presentation slides onto the public H195 website; please let us know if you would prefer to keep them private.
This part will be presented in class {{ page.date.due | date: "%a %m/%d" }}.
