title: CS H195 QQC Journal
---

**Note**: This QQC Journal is for CS H195 students only. If you are a CS195 student, you should submit QQCs via Ed according to the [CS 195 syllabus]({{site.base_url}}/syllabus). If you are a CS H195 student, you should only use this document, not Ed.

## The QQC Journal

The QQC Journal is a Google document shared with the instructor of the class and will serve as a bibliography and notes for the readings. It will also include any additional journal entries that are required for the course.

In the real world, no one actually checks your notes to hold you to some standard. The only person that might ever care is the future you that has to go back and use those notes. However, the intention behind this exercise is to provide structure and help you practice reasonable organization and note-taking skills with course staff to hold you accountable.

To start, create and share a Google document with the instructor and TA(s), and submit it via the bCourses assignment.

## Document Format

* Google doc name: “QQC Doc: Given_name Surname” – replace Given_name Surname with your name such that it can be matched to your name in the gradebook.
* Contents for each discussion section:
  * Header for each Discussion date with format "Heading 1" so it appears in the document outline.
  * Contents for each reading due by this Discussion date:
    * Title of the reading with the format “Heading 2”, so they appear in the document outline.
    * Citation – Must contain title, author, publication venue, and year (Google Scholar’s Cite feature will help)
    * Link to the reading (optional, if useful to you).
    * Your three QQCs about the reading. See below for details.
  * Additional journal entries, if any, for the week. Title as "Journal Entry" with format "Heading 2".

## QQC

QQC stands for **Question, Quote, or Comment**. The QQC assignment is a short weekly assignment to help you reflect on the readings and contribute to the upcoming class discussion.

Before discussion each week, submit three QQCs for each CS 195 reading _and_ CS H195 reading. A QQC can be a question about the reading, a quote from the reading, or a comment/reaction to a particular part of the reading. For the assignment itself, you do not need to submit one of each; rather, you can submit a mix.

## Grading

To receive full credit:
* Within the first two weeks, the document exists and is shared with all course staff; the document also is submitted through bCourses.
* Format is such that there is a "Heading 1" for each discussion, and "Heading 2" for each reading under the corresponding discussion.
* Three QQCs exist for each reading.
* All additional journal entries (see [Readings and Journal Entries]({{site.base_url}}/discussion#cs-h195-readings-and-journal-entries) exist under the corresponding discussion.

This document will be graded periodically throughout the semester by TAs.
