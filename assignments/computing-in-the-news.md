: **Due Tue. 04/25, 11:59pm**

## Assignment Description

For this assignment, you are not restricted to topics covered in lectures!
However, any topic you choose should still be related to the "social
implications of computing technology."

Choose two articles published in 2023 that cover the same topic, concept, or
current event:

1. The first article must be a non-opinion piece from a "top 10" news website,
   which are: TODO. If you would like to use a different site, please check
   with us first.
2. The second article must be an opinion piece from any news or blog site.

Your essay will consist of two paragraphs:

1. In the first paragraph, summarize and provide context for the topic, concept,
   or current event.
2. In the second paragraph, compare and contrast the news article and opinion
   piece. As part of your analysis, consider the perspective of the opinion
   piece's author. Who are they, and why did they include or omit certain
   details?
