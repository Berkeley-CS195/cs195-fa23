: Assigned Thu. 04/27 via bCourses, **due Wed. 05/03, 11:59pm**

## Assignment Description

For this assignment, you are not restricted to topics covered in lectures!
However, any topic you choose should still be related to the "social
implications of computing technology."

Choose two articles published in <b>2023</b> that cover the same topic, concept, or
current event:

1. The first article must be a <b>non-opinion</b> piece from a "top,"
   "reputable," "unbiased" news website. Our tentative, non-exhaustive list is
   AP, BBC, NPR, NYT, WSJ,  CNN, LA Times, Reuters, The New Yorker, Bloomberg,
   Forbes, The Guardian, Pew Research, The Economist, TIME, etc. If you want to
   use a news site not on this list, just check with us first and we'll confirm.
   Part of our analysis will probably involve checking the
   [Media Bias Chart](https://adfontesmedia.com).
2. The second article must be an <b>opinion piece</b> from any news or blog site.

Your essay will consist of two paragraphs:

1. In the first paragraph, summarize and provide context for the topic, concept,
   or current event.
2. In the second paragraph, compare and contrast the news article and opinion
   piece. As part of your analysis, consider the perspective of the opinion
   piece's author. Who are they, and why did they include or omit certain
   details?

   (This is why we want the first article to be reasonably impartial --
   if we drew from a biased source, we would be comparing to a different
   baseline.)

## Essay Format

Title
: Please include your title at the top of the page.

Essay Length
: Essays should be short: 300-500 words, excluding references.

References
: Include your references separately at the end of the essay. The format is not
  important as long as the references are unambiguous and include website links
  as full URLs where applicable. For example:

  NPR, "New Research Casts Doubt On Connection Between Smartphone Use And Teen
  Mental Health.‚Äù <https://www.npr.org/2019/08/19/752529380/new-research-casts-doubt-on-connection-between-smartphone-use-and-teen-mental-he>
  Accessed 9/19/22.

Style
: The writeup does not require a particular format (APA, MLA, etc are
  acceptable). However, it is a college-level essay, and the writing should
  still be professional.

Format
: The bCourses assignment will accept a PDF. This PDF must contain English
  prose.

## Grading and Rubric

Your essay will be evaluated by three of your peers on each of the following
criteria (each on a 2-point scale):

{: .rubric-table }
| Category | 2 points | 1 point | 0 points |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Summary is coherent. | Summarizes the topic in a coherent, balanced manner. | Attempts a summary, but it should be rewritten. | Incoherent/Irrelevant/blank |
| Essay makes a meaningful comparison. | Makes a comparison that considers the authors' pespectives. | Compares the articles, but does not consider author perspectives. | Does not compare the articles. |
| Essay writing is clear. | Uses well-written sentences with few spelling/grammatical errors. | Has several stylistic/spelling/grammatical errors that detract from the essay. | Illegible/blank |
| Cited sources meet criteria. | One citation is a non-opinion piece from a top, reputable, unbiased news source, and the other is an opinion piece on the same topic. | One citation does not meet the criteria or only one source is cited. | Cites 0 sources. |

Instructional staff may also spot-review essays and provide comments/share ideas.
