- Complete reading notes for the following and submit in bCourses:
  - *Why are all the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?* Chapter 8.
    We will not use the online library copy, as we will use the 2021 edition.
    I sent a PDF to attending students.
  - [*Hacking Diversity*](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/77375) Chapter 5. The book
    is available for free online at the link.
- Do the
  [Invisible EECS Knapsack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_mbxguycaOqPRnHDCJ5vDEk5UutxSFgSZmqgVblOFHE/edit)
  activity.
  - Don’t report individual responses, but have your score ready for 2/17’s
    discussion. What was interesting about the list to you? Is there anything
    that you would add to the knapsack that contributes to your identity as a
    CS student? Why? Do you have any other thoughts on the knapsack and its
    relation to “privilege in EECS”? Respond in a paragraph, to be submitted on
    bCourses.
